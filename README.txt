This project is regarding development of a virtual assistant like Amazon's Alexa and Google Home. 

The project is made using MATLAB software. 

You can run the software 
on MATLAB and give the instructions to the assistant from your phone by voice.

You can add as many things you want the assistant to do like opening a webpage aur knowing the weather conditions and other
day to day general activities.

The main work is already done in the code scripts provided and to add something you just need to add few lines which can be
easily understood just by looking at the code. However major programming part and some things which should be done by an ideal
virtual assistant is already added in this code.

For further details please refer to the PDF file in the repository which contains detailed version of the project

HOW TO USE IT:-

2. Load and compile all the 3 scripts in MATLAB.

3. Start the app in smartphone.

4. Run the voice_to_text script.

5. Now the script will search your smartphone using bluetooth. Connect to your device from popup menu.

6. Enjoy giving instructions and get your work done just by your voice by tapping mic in the mobile app.
